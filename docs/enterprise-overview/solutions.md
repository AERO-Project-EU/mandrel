# Oracle GraalVM

## Challenges Today’s Businesses Face

Today’s online global enterprises and microservices alike face the same needs:
achieving better performance, and reducing ever-increasing infrastructure costs.
The evolution from older, layered architectures to microservices requires new,
innovative approaches to running a business either on premises or on the cloud.

Speed, dexterity, and leanness are key, then, to commanding the modern
online marketplace.

## Faster, Smaller, Leaner Applications

Oracle GraalVM is a foundation for innovation and improvement for both large
enterprise applications and microservices alike.

Built on trusted and secure Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM accelerates
application performance while consuming fewer resources — improving application
efficiency and reducing IT costs.

In data centers with ever-growing workloads, being able to service more
requests with the same computing infrastructure reduces the need to purchase
additional hardware. Thus Oracle GraalVM's reduction of required compute
resources can lower capital cost expenditures on premise and lower operation
costs on cloud.

## Trusted Oracle Support and Updates

Oracle GraalVM customers take advantage of 24/7 access to the experienced Oracle GraalVM
support team who work closely with the Oracle Java support team.

Oracle GraalVM releases include all Oracle Java critical patch updates
(CPUs) which are released on a regular schedule to remedy defects and known
vulnerabilities.

* reduce IT and storage costs
