# Oracle GraalVM on OCI Compute Instances with Oracle Linux

This guide describes how to install Oracle GraalVM on an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Compute instance with Oracle Linux 7, 8, and 9.
For complete beginners, [start with this tutorial to create and launch your first Linux instance](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Reference/overviewworkflow.htm).

> Note: [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud) provides Oracle GraalVM to its customers for free. The support is included in the Oracle Cloud subscription.

### Prerequisites

To replicate the steps in this guide, [create a Compute instance and connect to it](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Reference/overviewworkflow.htm).

## Install Oracle GraalVM

For convenience, Oracle GraalVM RPMs are available in the Oracle YUM repository. 
That means that OCI customers can use Oracle GraalVM in their compute instances, just like any other Java Development Kit, by installing it with `yum`, `dnf`, or `microdnf` default package managers, depending on the Oracle Linux version.

The following instructions have been tested on an OCI Compute Instance with **Oracle Linux 8** and **VM.Standard.E4.Flex** with 1 OCPU and 16 GB RAM.

Use the following command to connect to the OCI Compute Instance from a Unix-style system:

   ```shell
   ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa opc@INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
   ```

Where `.ssh/id_rsa` is the full path and name of the file containing your private SSH key; `opc` is the default name for the Oracle Linux image; and `INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP` is the instance IP address provisioned from the console.
For more details, refer to theÂ [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/testingconnection.htm) tutorial.

There are Oracle GraalVM RPMs for JDK 20 and JDK 17 with the following package names: `graalvm-17-native-image` and `graalvm-20-native-image`. 
These Oracle GraalVM distributions include a JDK and Natime Image.
Each Oracle GraalVM RPM is self-contained and all required dependencies will be automatically resolved during the installation.

The installation steps may differ per Oracle Linux version or package manager. 

### Oracle Linux 7

1. Install newer devtoolset with GCC version 10 (required by Oracle GraalVM Native Image):
   ```shell
   sudo yum -y install oracle-softwarecollection-release-el7
   ```
   ```shell
   sudo yum install devtoolset-10
   ```
2. Enable the newer devtoolset by default:
   ```shell
   echo 'source scl_source enable devtoolset-10' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
3. Enter a new bash session with the newer devtoolset enabled:
   ```
   bash
   ```
4. Install Oracle GraalVM, for example, for JDK 20:
   ```
   sudo yum install graalvm-20-native-image
   ```
   Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.

### Oracle Linux 8 and 9

On Oracle Linux 8 and 9 with the `yum` package manager, run these commands one by one:
```shell
sudo yum update -y oraclelinux-release-el8
```
```shell
sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled ol8_codeready_builder
```
```shell
sudo yum install graalvm-20-native-image
```
Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.

On Oracle Linux 8 and 9 with `dnf` or `microdnf` default package managers, run these commands one by one:
```shell
dnf update -y oraclelinux-release-el8
```
```shell
dnf config-manager --set-enabled ol8_codeready_builder
```
```shell
dnf install graalvm-20-native-image
```
Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.

### Configure Environment Variables

Configure environment variables to point to the Oracle GraalVM installation for this SSH session. 
After installation, the package files are placed in the _/usr/lib64/graalvm_ directory, and binaries in _bin_ accordingly.

1. Set the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables in the bash configuration to point to Oracle GraalVM with the following commands:
   ```shell
   echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib64/graalvm/graalvm-jdk-20.0.1" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
   ```shell
   echo 'export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Activate this change:
   ```shell
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
3. Check the values of `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME`, and the Java version to confirm the installation was successful:
   ```shell
   echo $JAVA_HOME
   ```
   ```shell
   echo $PATH
   ```
   ```shell
   java -version
   ```

Now you have a ready-to-go OCI Compute instance with Oracle GraalVM installed.

## Install Additional Features

<<<<<<< HEAD
Oracle GraalVM consists of several features and components&emdash;JDK, Native Image, Javascript runtime, and Node.js runtime&emdash;each of which can be installed separately or as an add-on. 
See the [Distribution Components List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/jdk/20/docs/support/#certified-platforms) for more information.

To add additional features to Oracle GraalVM, use the `yum install <package_name>` command. 
=======
Oracle GraalVM provides more technologies such as the Javascript runtime, Java on Truffle, etc., each of which can be installed as an add-on. 
See the [Features Support list](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/jdk/20/docs/support/#features-support) for more information.
>>>>>>> 6fdbfcd0b54 (Rewrite Oracle GraalVM on OCI Compute Instances guide")

1. Check what additional features are available for your current Oracle GraalVM installation:

   ```shell
   sudo yum list graalvm-20*
   ```
   ```shell
   dnf list graalvm-20*
   ```
   The printed list is very large. If you are interested in a particular feature, for example, the Python runtime, narrow down the search providing the exact package name:

   ```shell
   sudo yum list graalvm-20-python*
   ```
   ```shell
   dnf list graalvm-20-python*
   ```


2. Install the feature to Oracle GraalVM using its `<package_name>`. For example, to install the Python runtime with `yum`, run:
   ```shell
   sudo yum install graalvm-20-python
   ```
   With `dnf`:
   ```shell
   dnf install graalvm-20-python
   ```
   Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.

## Update Oracle GraalVM

You can update an existing Oracle GraalVM or replace it with another version. 

1. To replace with another version, for example, from JDK version 20 to 17, run:

   ```shell
   sudo yum install graalvm-17-native-image
   ```

2. Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.

The **graalvm-17-native-image** package is installed alongside **ggraalvm-20-native-image** in the _/usr/lib64/graalvm_ directory. Note that regardless the version printed to the console, the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables still point to the old version. Reset the variables as described in [Configure Environment Variables](#configure-environment-variables).
